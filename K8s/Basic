**In the manifest (YAML or JSON file) for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:** 

**apiVersion** - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
**kind**  - What kind of object you want to create
metadata - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace
spec - What state you desire for the object


The precise format of the object spec is different for every Kubernetes object, and contains nested fields specific to that object.

The kubectl command-line tool supports several different ways to create and manage Kubernetes objects.
